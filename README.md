# TRIVIA bot

A little project to answer trivia questions with off the shelf components.
Given a question it will:
1. Use extract named entites
2. Find wiki pages for these entities
3. Attempt to use huggingface question answering pipeline to find the answers.


# TO RUN:
Please install requirements as per `requirements.txt` and run `notebooks\triviabot.ipynb`. This will eventually be moved to streamlit or similar.
